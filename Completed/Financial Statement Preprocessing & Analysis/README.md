# Income Statement Preprocessing & Analysis (Year 2000-2024)
## Brief Overview
We aim to perform data cleaning & analysis on API-retrieved ([Financial Modelling Prep](https://financialmodelingprep.com/api/v3/stock/list?apikey=NSD2m35XyjrwOoYdtKbq1JPOHlABl8CW) income statements of different companies from US-listed exchanges (i.e. NYSE, NASDAQ, AMEX).

These income statements consolidate revenue, profit and expense data (e.g. Gross Profit, Net Income, Operating Expenses) from year 2000-2024 to generate an overall Profit & Loss statement (P&L). 

The data insights are also presented on an Excel dashboard to give a summary on the general performance of the companies (split into Revenue, Profit, Expense), alongside recommendations these companies should consider in the future to improve profitability and reduce expenses.

Besides API-retrieved data which contains real income statements, we have also generated synthetic datasets containing simulated financial metrics and stocks to complement the data and be able to demonstrate various data preprocessing steps.
