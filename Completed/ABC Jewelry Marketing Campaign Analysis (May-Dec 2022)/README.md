# ABC Jewelry Marketing Campaign Analysis (May-Dec 2022)
## Brief Overview
ABC Jewelry is a fictitious jewelry brand. Using the dataset available in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rahulchavan99/marketing-campaign-dataset/code), I clean the dataset and analyze 72,603 of campaign data. Presenting the results to the brand and marketing team, I discuss the ROI of the 7-month long campaign using several important KPI metrics, with a focus on Clickthrough Rate (CTR, click/impressions). along with actionable recommendations for future campaigns.
